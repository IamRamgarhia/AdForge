              Truly free. $0/month forever. MIT-licensed. The only cost is whatever you spend with
              your chosen AI provider — and four of the nine supported providers (Groq, Gemini,

              There's no business model. OpenAdKit is open-source under MIT, built by Dicecodes
              as a free tool for the marketing community. No upsells, no premium tier, no paid
              add-ons. The code is on GitHub — you can audit, fork, modify, self-host.

              Yes. There's nothing to import — OpenAdKit's Brand Brain extracts everything it needs
              from your website URL in one click. Paste your brand site, get a populated brand
              profile, start generating. Total switching time is usually 5–10 minutes.
